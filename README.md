# Carbon-Storage-Estimation-XAI

Files 1-1 and 1-2 are the codes for extracting 12 types of dominant vegetation using remote sensing data.

Files 2-1 and 2-2 are the codes for calculating carbon storage based on the corresponding carbon density. Codes 2-3 are for calculating carbon storage using a 100-meter fishing net.

Files 2-4, 2-5, and 2-6 are the codes for regression modeling of data using Random Forest, LightGBM, and XGBoost.

File 2-7 contains the code for shap analysis using data and the XGBoost model. Codes 2-8 and 2-9 are for drawing the summary and the dependency diagram respectively. Code 2-10 are for mapping shap values onto the map.

File 2-11 is the code for combining shap and map analysis dividing lines. File 2-12 is the code for analyzing the uncertainty of carbon storage using Monte Carlo simulation.
